		<h3 class="blueclass"> What Exactly Is LabVIEW, and What Can It Do for Me? </h3>
		
		<p> 
			LabVIEW, short for Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench, <i>is a programming</i> environment in which you create programs using a graphical notation (connecting functional nodes via wires through which data flows); in this regard, it differs from traditional programming languages like C, C++, or Java, in which you program with text. However, LabVIEW is much more than a programming language. <strong>It is an interactive program</strong> development and <u>execution system designed for people</u>, like scientists and engineers, who need to program as part of their jobs. The LabVIEW development environment works on computers running Windows,<em> Mac OS X, or Linux.</em> LabVIEW can create programs that run on those platforms, as well as Microsoft Pocket PC, Microsoft Windows CE, Palm OS, and a variety of embedded platforms, including Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), and microprocessors.

		<p>
			Using the very powerful graphical programming language that many <b>LabVIEW users affectionately</b> call "G" (for graphical), LabVIEW can increase your productivity by orders of magnitude. Programs that take weeks or months to write using conventional programming languages can be completed in hours using LabVIEW because it is specifically designed to take measurements, analyze data, and present results to the user. And because LabVIEW has such a versatile graphical user interface and is so easy to program with, it is also ideal for simulations, presentation of ideas, general programming, or even teaching basic programming concepts.

		<hr>
		
			<br>LabVIEW offers more flexibility than standard laboratory instruments because it is software-based. You, not the instrument manufacturer, define instrument functionality. Your computer, plug-in hardware, and LabVIEW comprise a completely configurable virtual instrument to accomplish your tasks. Using LabVIEW, you can create exactly the type of virtual instrument you need, when you need it, at a fraction of the cost of traditional instruments. When your needs change, you can modify your virtual instrument in moments.

			A warning message is a modal dialog box, in-place message, notification, or balloon that alerts the user of a condition that might cause a problem in the future. A typical modal warning message.

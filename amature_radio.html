				<p>I became interested in amature radio after I captured an image from a passing weather satellite! It was a NOAA 15 northbound 74E at 08 Aug 2020 01:58:18 GMT on 137.62MHz. As you can see it's not the best quality, but it was fun to learn more about the NOAA 15 satellite and how the RF travels. If you want to learn more about how to recieve NOAA weather satellite data check out my Receiveing NOAA Weather Satellite Data Using a RTL/SDR.</p>

				My call sign is KJ7WME. I currently us an Yaesus FT3D radio with stock antenna.

				<p>Orbitron is a satellite tracking system for radio amateur and observing purposes. It's also used by weather professionals, satellite communication users, astronomers, UFO hobbyist and even astrologers.

				Application shows the positions of satellites at any given moment (in real or simulated time). It's FREE (Cardware) and it's probably one of the easiest and most powerful satellite trackers, according to opinions of thousands of users from all over the world. I'm still working on it, waiting for your opinions and bug reports. Please try it. If you like it - tell your friends about it and send me a postcard...
